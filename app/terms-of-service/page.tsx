                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">1.1 The Interface</h3>
                <p>
                  The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of access to decentralized protocols on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Interface is distinct from the Stele Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol comprises open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various public blockchains, such as Ethereum and Arbitrum. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us. Stele Finance does not operate or manage challenge entry fees. Challenge entry fees are distributed to the top 1–5 ranked users according to the allocation ratios defined in the Stele Protocol. Stele Finance does not manage fund assets. Deposits and withdrawals of fund assets can only be performed by the investor themselves. Fund fees are allocated to the fund manager in accordance with the Protocol. Fund managers may only rebalance the fund portfolio by swapping assets. Stele Finance does not supervise or control fund managers. The Protocol was initially deployed on the Ethereum and Arbitrum blockchain. Please note that digital assets that have been "bridged" or "wrapped" to operate on other blockchain networks (including to blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine that are designed to ensure the Ethereum blockchain can effectively process more transactions or other blockchains that are frequently referred to as "Layer 2" solutions) are distinct from the original Ethereum mainnet asset.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To access the Interface, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service. We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">1.2 Access through Third-Party Partners</h3>
                <p>
                  We may make certain Products, including access to our APIs, liquidity services, and data, accessible or usable through interfaces, products or services provided by certain third-party partners, such as exchanges and trading platforms (each a "Third-Party Partner").

                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">1.5 Third-Party Services and Content</h3>

You further agree that each of our Products shall be deemed to be based solely in Singapore, and that although a Product may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside Singapore. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences interstate commerce. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Arbitration Act (Cap. 10) of Singapore. You agree that the courts of Singapore are the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this Agreement's binding arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.

Details regarding the criteria for earning a reward will be described within the applicable Product or official Stele documentation. Upon satisfaction of the criteria for obtaining a reward and subject to your compliance with the associated rewards terms, this Agreement, and applicable law — to be determined exclusively by Stele — we or an applicable Third-Party Partner will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly transfer the earned reward to the digital wallet that you designate or have connected to the applicable Product.

You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your behalf. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on public distributed blockchains like Ethereum. As a result, we do not (and cannot) guarantee market best pricing or best execution through our Products or when using our Auto Routing feature, which routes trades across liquidity pools on the Protocol only. Any references in a Product to "best price" does not constitute a representation or warranty about pricing available through such Product, on the Protocol, or elsewhere.
